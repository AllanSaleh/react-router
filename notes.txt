----- Ways to navigate using provided React Router DOM tools -----

Link - Prevents a full page reload (unlike anchor tags), and will render the page you wish to navigate to.

NavLink - Does the same thing that Link does but NavLink knows which route is cuurntly active, it has an isActive prop

useNavigate - is a hook in react that gives us a function that we can call to navigate the user to a particular page
